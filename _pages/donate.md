**Our team is back thanks to you, our community of supporters!**
We are so grateful to the family, friends and sponsors who helped SERT rebuild our team after the COVID shut down. Not only did we come back last year, we came back strong, ending our season with our highest-ever rank at the Pacific Northwest Championships. That wouldn’t have happened without your support. Thank you!

**We're building on success.**
This year, we've had an unprecedented influx of new members, all learning the CAD, mechanical, electrical, and programming skills needed to build a competition-ready robot. We're ready to break through to the next level of competition, knowing that requires funding new equipment. Significantly, it means investing in a swerve drivetrain, the standard for fast and nimble robots.

**Can you help us across the finish line?**
We've raised most of the money needed to fund this upgrade, but walk a narrow path: Parts break, materials need replenishing, and tools need upgrading–often when you least expect it or can afford it. Your donation will go a long way to helping us build and compete with confidence!

**SERT is more than just robots.** 
SERT helps members develop practical engineering knowledge while fostering leadership, communication and collaboration skills. We’ve restarted numerous pre-COVID programs like community volunteering, equity outreach, gender-diverse inclusion efforts, and summer camps like GoBabyGo, which adapts ride-on cars to be mobility aids for children with motor impairments.

**Every bit helps.**
We are deeply grateful for contributions of all sizes, and most of all, for being part of a community that continues to cheer us on, year after year.

**Thank you for helping us become the leaders of tomorrow!**
