## What is SERT Smash?

SERT Smash is a hackathon put on by SERT located in Eugene, Oregon, open to all
high-school students. There will be a surprise challenge and awards for the
winners.

## Who's invited?

All high-school students are invited to participate in SERT Smash. No FRC or
robotics experience is required, but it's a great opportunity for software teams
to practice coding and working together.

## How will it work?

At 8:00 AM on May 20th, 2017, the challenge will be announced and teams will
begin working on their entry. Teams may consist of up to 5 students and an adult
 member. Throughout the day, they'll continue to code.

At the end of the day, teams will create a pull request to the SERT Smash
GitHub repository to enter their code, which will be released under
the MIT license. After teams present their projects, judges will deliberate and
announce a winner.

## Where is it located?

SERT Smash will be located in Eugene, Oregon at South Eugene High School.
