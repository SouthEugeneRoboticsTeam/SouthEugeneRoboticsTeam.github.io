## Go Baby Go

In partnership with Oregon Statue University, we participate and contribute to the Go
Baby Go! initiative to build alternative transportation for children with limited
mobility. We designed a 3D-printable joystick for the "trucks" such that children
that use them can gently accelerate, instead of using a button that goes from stopped
to full speed immediately. Our joystick design gives children hours of fun therapy
and makes transportation easier.

## Supporting Women in STEM

In addition to our strong female student leadership (75% of all captains/leads are
female), our team makes a number of efforts to support and promote women in STEM. We
recently taught an 8 week-long class at Ophelia's Place in CAD, an organization that
supports girls in the community. We've also donated four desktop computers to them,
for educational use.

Our team also attends events to encourage girls on our team to network with female
professionals, such as the Oregon State University Women in Engineering Dinner, as
well as the Women In Science and Engineering Symposium.

To encourage girls in our community to explore STEM and FIRST, we run demonstrations
at Ophelia's Place's Girls Rule! event, as well as at SPICE camp, a girls' science
camp at the University of Oregon.

### Upcoming Events

We will be teaching workshops at Girls Rule! 2017, a free event for girls aged 9-14
at Churchill High School on April 11th.

## Software tools

SERT has built many tools over the years to make various tasks faster and easier, all of which are open-source.
Here are just a few of them:

1. **[🤖 Robot Scouter](https://github.com/SUPERCILEX/Robot-Scouter/)** is a simple yet powerful Android
scouting app with customizable scouting templates and advanced spreadsheet exporting for painless data analysis.
1. The **[🕑 Attendance Client](https://github.com/SouthEugeneRoboticsTeam/Attendance-Client)**
is a cross-platform desktop app built with Firebase and React to make keeping track of team members' hours a piece of cake.
1. Vision processing code for [single-board computers](https://github.com/SouthEugeneRoboticsTeam/vision)
such as the Raspberry Pi or for the
[roboRIO](https://github.com/SouthEugeneRoboticsTeam/Steamworks-2017/blob/71a63ba36a162f533b1fb9a52d1f1b8c61748378/src/org/usfirst/frc/team2521/robot/vision/Looper.java).

## Past Demonstrations

SERT maintains its longstanding partnerships with the community by frequently
participating in events that raise awareness of FIRST and STEM values. For the past
three summers, we have participated in the Mini Maker Faire at the Science Factory,
our local children’s science museum, where more than 50 kids of all ages drove our
Aerial Assist robot, Byter, and learned about FIRST. After that, our team set up a
popular hands-on exhibit for three days at the well-attended Lane County Fair and
gave community members the opportunity to drive our robots, an annual SERT event. At
the Oregon State Fair, we participated in a FIRST exhibit with our robot and taught
children and  parents from around the state about FIRST and the opportunities
available to FIRST teams.

Additionally, our team was invited to the Second Star Festival in Florence, Oregon
where we gave TED-style talks and demonstrated a previous season’s robot design. In
November, our team participated in the Barnes & Noble Maker Faire and taught many
children about robotics, a continuing event.

We recently demonstrated our Aerial Assist robot, Byter, at Kids Down South Preschool
on February 1st. On February 24th, demonstrated the same robot and presented about
our team at the Emerald Valley Assisted Living Center.
