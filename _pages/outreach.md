## Go Baby Go

In partnership with Oregon Statue University, we participate and contribute to the Go Baby Go! initiative to build alternative transportation for children with limited mobility. We designed a 3D-printable joystick for the "trucks" such that children that use them can gently accelerate, instead of using a button that goes from stopped to full speed immediately. Our joystick design gives children hours of fun therapy and makes transportation easier.

## Supporting Women in STEM

In addition to our strong female student leadership (75% of all captains/leads are female), our team makes a number of efforts to support and promote women in STEM. We recently taught an 8 week-long class at Ophelia's Place in CAD, an organization that supports girls in the community. We've also donated four desktop computers to them, for educational use. 

Our team also attends events to encourage girls on our team to network with female professionals, such as the Oregon State University Women in Engineering Dinner, as well as the Women In Science and Engineering Symposium. 

To encourage girls in our community to explore STEM and FIRST, we run demonstrations at Ophelia's Place's Girls Rule! event, as well as at SPICE camp, a girls' science camp at the University of Oregon.

## Upcoming Events

We will be teaching workshops at Girls Rule! 2017, a free event for girls aged 9-14 at Churchill High School on April 11th. Also, catch us hosting our VERY OWN HACKATHON on May 20 in South Eugene High School cafeteria! Stay tuned for more details.

## Upcoming Demonstrations

We will be demonstrating our Aerial Assist robot, Byter, at Kids Down South
Preschool on February 1st. On February 24th, we will be demonstrating the same
robot and presenting about our team at the Emerald Valley Assisted Living
Center.

## Past Demonstrations

SERT maintains its longstanding partnerships with the community by  frequently
participating in events that raise awareness of FIRST and STEM values. For the
past three summers, we have participated in the Mini Maker Faire at the Science
Factory, our local children’s science museum, where more than 50 kids of all
ages drove our Aerial Assist robot, Byter, and learned about FIRST. After that,
our team set up a popular hands-on exhibit for three days at the well-attended
Lane County Fair and gave community members the opportunity to drive our
robots, an annual SERT event. At the Oregon State Fair, we participated in a
FIRST exhibit with our robot and taught children and  parents from around the
state about FIRST and the opportunities available to FIRST teams.

Additionally, our team was invited to the Second Star Festival in Florence,
Oregon where we gave TED-style talks and demonstrated a previous season’s robot
design. In November, our team participated in the Barnes & Noble Maker Faire
and taught many children about robotics, a continuing event.
