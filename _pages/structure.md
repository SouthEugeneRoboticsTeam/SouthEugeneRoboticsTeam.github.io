amount about a broad array of subjects until he shadowed Anthony (the resident expert in all things
mechanical). Notably he was the human player for the drive team that when to world's. Sophomore year
largely consisted of work in the mechanical subteam as well as contributions to the scouting and
drive team. At the end of Sophomore year Alex had taken on the job of 3d printing guru and been
elected Strategy subteam lead. As Strategy lead he built the Strategy subteam from scratch and
oversaw the creation of a top notch scouting app. In addition he coordinated the updating of the
team handbook, contributed to the mechanical team and coached drive team. When Alex isn't doing

{: .people-text .right}
Emerald Ayers is one of the co-captains at South Eugene Robotics Team, and
a senior at North Eugene High School. As a younger sibling of a former team captain, Emerald got
her robotics start before she began high school. As a freshman she shadowed the legendary Ben
Davidson, and became attached to the mechanical side of the build. During her sophomore year she
dabbled in electrical and business, and was one of three girls who competed in the St. Louis
Championships. Her junior year, she created an all new drivetrain, basically reinventing the wheel.
At the same time she also captained North Eugene’s FTC team, N.E.R.D. during their second season.
As a senior and co-captain Emerald oversees the design, fabrication, and strategy surrounding the
robot. When not building robots and conquering the world, Emerald enjoys baking, choir, and dying
her hair weird colors. </div>

## Subteams

### Mechanical
The mechanical subteam is responsible for the design and fabrication of the
robot. During the first few days of build season, mechanical designs and
creates CAD models and prototypes of proposed mechanisms of the robot. After
different mechanisms have been tested and eliminated, mechanical designs a CAD
model and builds a test model of the robot. After the test robot has been
tested and altered, a final robot is built.

### Software
The software subteam writes code for the robot and the driver station.
Specifically using Java as their programming language, the software subteam
writes code to make the robot autonomously function as effectively as possible.
In addition to autonomously programming the robot, software is also responsible
for making the driver station effectual and comprehendible.

### Business
The business subteam is responsible for updating the website, writing grants
and award submissions, acquiring sponsors, planning outreach events, creating
marketing material to recruit new team members and mentors, and maintaining an
active social media presence.

### Electrical
The electrical subteam creates a control system for the robot. By wiring
electronics and creating a control system, software is able to operate the
robot.

### Strategy
The strategy subteam formulates a game plan on what functions to prioritize on
the robot. In addition, during competition season, the strategy subteam is
responsible for scouting other robots.
