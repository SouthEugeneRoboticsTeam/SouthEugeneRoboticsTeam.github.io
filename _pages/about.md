## What is FRC?

The [FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)](http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc)
is an annual competition that brings together robotics teams from all around the
world to compete with and against each other. For every season, a
challenge is set forth and each team is given six weeks to construct a functional
robot in order to fulfill the challenge requirements. Dubbed as the "hardest fun
you'll ever have," FRC is a challenging and exciting opportunity for high school
students that not only teaches them the fundamental elements of technology but the
experience of working in a microcosm of a small tech company.


## Our Story

The South Eugene Robotics Team (SERT) was founded in 2007 by Leighton Barnes (SEHS
Class of 2009). SERT is the only FRC team in the Eugene/Springfield area, and has
included students who are home-schooled as well as students from South Eugene,
Willamette, and North Eugene High Schools. Over the last eight seasons, we have
continuously increased our team numbers, currently from seven to over fifty, with over
one third being females. We also increased our mentor numbers from the initial one
to seven this year. Our mentors bring a varying number of skills to the team, ranging
from engineering to business. Last year, we were able to field a team for Girls
Generation, an off-season special event that is focused on the integration of girls
and new team members into the world of FRC.

Most high schools don’t offer shop, mechanics, or engineering classes, so SERT is one
of the few opportunities for students to learn these skills. In a world where
technology is everywhere, the skills we acquire through the robotics team are
invaluable. Our team offers a wonderful opportunity to learn engineering and
programming, skills that will serve us well in this increasingly technology oriented
future. We also develop recruitment materials, fundraising presentations, and business
plans. These aspects of SERT help us gain skills in graphic design, financial planning,
community outreach, and interpersonal “Gracious Professionalism” - a FIRST value.
