We will be appearing at the Oregon State Fair August 26th-29th with our 2016 competition robot,
Gary Spice. We will be engaging in friendly competition and will be there to answer any and all
questions about our team and about robotics and FRC in general. Come pick up a free SERT
bracelet and a pamphlet and check out our bot!
