SERT is preparing to take our Steamworks robot, Phantom, to the competition at the Clackamas Academy of Industrial Sciences 
in Oregon City. We will be competiting on Friday March 24th and Saturday March 25th. 

We are especially excited for Oregon City because it will be our first competition using our very own climber, due to some 
robot adjustments.

There will be a live-stream link on our Facebook and Twitter accounts once it goes live.
