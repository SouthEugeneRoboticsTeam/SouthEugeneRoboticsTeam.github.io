Currently, our team is in the beginning stages of build season. The game this year is FIRST Steamworks. You can check it out here: [https://youtu.be/EMiNmJW7enI](https://youtu.be/EMiNmJW7enI).

When we're not working on building robots, we reach out to the community through volunteering and events. A project we have been working on is building and donating interactive transportation for children in need of wheelchairs, which we hope to spread to the community soon through workshops :)
